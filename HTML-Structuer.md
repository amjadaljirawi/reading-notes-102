# The use of **HTML**
### HTML Describes the Structure of Pages
* <html>
* <body>
* <h1></h1> This is the Main Heading.
* <p></p> This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page or general paragraph.
* <h2></h2> This is a Sub-Heading.
* </body>
* </html>
#### as we can see at the previos example we have som sipmoles called tags and we have opennig and closing tags.Tags usually come in pairs.
####  To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
