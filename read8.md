# the Loop Counters
## There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. (Note that it's possible that number could be zero!)
**Loop Counters (for & while Loop)**
**Loops** :is used to checks a condition, if it's true, the code will run, and keep checking the code if it's true until the condition returns false.


### While Loops : the condition specifies that the code should run an unknown number of times from the begining. It should continue until the condition is met.
### For Loops : A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
