## Markdown is a way to style text on the web. Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
## Markdown is easier to write than HTML, and it's easier for most pepole to read Markdown source than HTML source.
so if we are talking about the Headers we can use (#) in the Markdown  insted of (<H1>) tag at the HTML, and we can use ## or ###### etc.
for example 
## sample 1
##### sample 2
###### sample 3
 And if we are talking about the Emphasis we can use ( * _ ) or a combination between them as the following example insted of the(<strong>)(<i> ) tags at the HTML.
  
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

_You **can** combine them_
## Also we have another characters for evrything else like: Lists,Images, and Blockquotes...etc like the following examples.
* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b
