## Every website should be designed for the target audience.To do that we can ask few questions:

* What is the age range of your target audience?
* Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix? 
* Which country do your visitors live in?
* Do they live in urban or rural areas?
* etc..
## Why People Visit YOUR Website?

 * Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
 * If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one?
 * Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
